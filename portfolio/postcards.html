            <h3>There is an art to repeating a process. Inspired by Michael Bierut's 100 Day Challenge, this project challenges me to create an iteration of an old design everyday for 50 days.The design work that I exercise this practice with is Erik Nitsche's cover design for General Dynamics Annual Report in 1955. Nitsche is a designer from the 20th century, who has strong eyes for color and shapes. He often played with the juxtaposition of elements.</h3>

            <h3>As simple as his designs look, Nitsche's style is hard to take on. His meticulous study of design elements is impressive and a different approach than what I'm used to. Throughout these 50 days, I was able to adopt his unique technique and make it my own.The final product became a collection of post cards. I handmade a slip-box and embellished with the original design Nitsche did as a stamp and the address of General Dynamics' headquarter. </h3>
