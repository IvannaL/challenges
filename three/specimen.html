      <h1>Georgia</h1>
      <p>"Typefaces slip in and out of fashion like every other area of design, but right now Georgia is the most fashionable one on the Internet."</p>

            <p>Although inspired by the need for—and providing—clarity at low resolutions on the screen, Georgia is a typeface resonant with typographic personality. Even at small sizes the face exudes a sense of friendliness; a feeling of intimacy many would argue has been eroded from Times New Roman through overuse. This is as much testament to the skill of the typeface’s designer, Matthew Carter, as it is to any intrinsic quality of the face’s design, since the small pixel spaces of the screen can be a harrowing canvas for any type designer. In Georgia, Carter has successfully managed to create a typeface family which combines high legibility with character and charm.</p>

        <h1>ITALIC</h1>
          <h2>Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt</h2>
          <p>Georgia’s accompanying italic is a graceful, flowing font, the design of which entirely masks the difficulty of creating an italic for the screen. Unlike many contemporary fonts, it is a true italic, containing such characters as the single-storeyed lowercase a and g. The bold weight of the typeface has been similarly carefully designed, to ensure that it is always heavier than the regular weight; an important consideration at small sizes on the screen, where it is often necessary to distinguish between the two.</p>

      <section class="bold">
        <h1>BOLD</h1>
          <h2>Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz ! @ # $ %</h2>
            <p>To create a font tailored for on-screen display, Carter had to make several departures from the Scotch mold. In Georgia, the uppercase characters are lightened, the x-height is increased, the ascenders rise above the cap height, and the numerals, often cut with a high degree of stress, have been evened out and made slightly non-aligning – a characteristic that imparts a flavor of individuality to any page set in Georgia.</p>
